Methods:
   in Java, a method is a block of code or a collection of statements that perform a specific task.
   It is designed to perform a particular function or piece of logic within a program.
   We can create a method and then call it multiple times from different parts of the program
    rather than repeating the same block of code in multiple places.
    Methods is Java returne types(output of a method) for example void,String ,int , char, etc.
   They can also take parameters(input).parameters can be primitive and non-primitive
   Body of the method can contain any logic like arrays,loops,switch,etc.

Why we should use Methods?
    1.Code re-usability
    2.Organize the code
    3.Changing code becomes easier
=========================================================
Types of variables w.r.t scope(coverage,reach,visibility and accesibiliry)
There are three types of variables with respect to scope local,instance and static variables
1.Local variables:
   1.Local variables are created inside the block of codes they can only be accessedvwith that block
   for example all the variables that create inside methods ,
   if statements,switch case statements ,loops etc.
2.Instance Variable
Instance variable are created outside of any block of code like method,
loop,if statement etc but they are inside a class.
