Constructor:
     A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
     It is used to initialize the object with the values provided as arguments to the constructor.
     If no constructor is defined in a class, a default constructor is automatically created by Java.
Rules:
     1.Constructor must have the same name as class name.
     2.Constructors don't have return types nor even void.
     3.When we don't create a Constructor in a class , Java creates a default constructor for us
     automatically behind the scense .It's called default constructor.It doese not take any parameters.
